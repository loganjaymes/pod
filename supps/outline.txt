===== START =====
X. set up circuit
===== GENERAL IO =====
X. put piezos in ADC pins (will need muxer later but LATER)
~. figure out note values for each drum head
X. in while loop, contiually read for input for each ADC pin
4. based on pin, send note value to DAW
5. add velocity in midi msg
===== MUXER =====
- idk
===== INTERRUPT/STATE/TOGGLE? =====
- a button of sorts that tells X pin to switch to midi note Y
	mostly for switching open hat to closed & vv
	ideally will be another piezo as a digital in since its faster to press than a button
- idk
